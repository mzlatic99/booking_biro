          Chui is a critically acclaimed space jazz rock band that is bringing
          jazz to a whole new galaxy. Heavily inspired by old science-fiction
          TV, feature films and comic culture, they’ve come up with a unique
          blend of music, firmly rooted in jazz but boldly venturing in other
          genres. Canterbury prog rock, numerous electronic music styles ranging
          from techno to UK garage, Dilla’s hip hop beats, even jazzcore – all
          traceable in Chui’s songbook.

          on Dancing Bear Records and “The Second Arrival” followed next year to
          widespread critical acclaim. Their third album “Third Sun from the
          Stone” was released in 2015. and voted the best Croatian album of the
          year by music critics. In 2017. Chui released a big band album “Chui
          ovu glazbu” performed alongside Croatian Radio-Television Jazz
          Orchestra and awarded with “Best jazz album”and “Best jazz
          performance” by Porin (Croatian equivalent of Grammy). In 2019. the
