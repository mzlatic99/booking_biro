          nemanja is a global psych band bringing together members from Pula and
          Zagreb, inspired by 70's Afro-Colombian, Turkish, Thai, and world
          music, spearheaded by Luka Šipetić with albums Tarot Funk, Cosmic
          Disco, and Voodoo Beat. The live band members are Ana Kovačić (sax,
          synth), Laura Matijašević (bass), Đuro Dobranić (drums), Laura
          Tandarić (percussion, vocals), and Luka Šipetić (guitar, vocals).

          The band is currently promoting their third album, Voodoo Beat, which
          presents a danceable and exciting musical melting pot of hot
          Afro-Colombian rhythms, Caribbean dub sounds, and tropical exotica,
          inspired by the ancient myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. It also draws
          inspiration from films like Orpheus (Jean Cocteau, 1950) and Black
          Orpheus (Marcel Camus, 1959). In addition to its intriguing musical
          influences, the albums stand out for their narrative concept that
          spans all three records, referencing tarot, Buddhism, and ancient
          myths, forming what they call the "Esoteric Trilogy." Tarot Funk
          portrays the last moments before nemanja's death through tarot cards
          and sounds inspired by 70s Anatolian rock; Cosmic Disco follows
          nemanja's journey through the bardo, the underworld, guided by the
          Tibetan Book of the Dead, with influences from African and Asian disco
          of the 70s and 80s; and Voodoo Beat concludes the "Esoteric Trilogy,"
          where nemanja attempts to return from the land of the dead with the
          help of voodoo powers of love and an Afro-Colombian sound.

          region have consistently placed Tarot Funk, Cosmic Disco, and Voodoo
          Beat at the top of the best albums lists in the region for 2019, 2020,
